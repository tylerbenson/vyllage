			<b>Career Goal</b>
				I am a fervid promoter of creating solutions. The rush of working with a team to launch a project that solves critical 
				problems and intersects with technology is extremely satisfying. I have a successful track record, in leading projects,
				growing new markets, and expanding existing opportunities. I’m an advocate for agile methodologies beyond the reach
				of traditional project management settings, but into building and forming teams as well. I have experience in starting
				businesses, helping others start theirs, and successfully building new territories and opportunities.
