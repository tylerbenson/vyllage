Add tables to a database schema document similar to https://github.com/natebenson/vyllage/blob/master/login/src/main/resources/schema-h2.sql
Each table should have an autogenerated id column.

Needs the following tables:
(Note, not all the columns need to be defined right now, mainly just want the referencial foreign keys set up linking them)

accounts - this will eventually link to data in the users table from the login project
- informal foreign key reference to login.users
- fields to store the data found in the contact drawer

documents - this is the main table which the id will represent the resume id in the url
- foreign key reference to accounts
- visibility settings for the contact data in accounts
- date created field
- last modified field

document_sections - this is where those json blobs will be stored.
- section version - combined key along with the section id
- foreign key reference to documents
- section sort order
- text blob to hold the json document  (when we get postgres setup, we'll be using their json type)
- date created field
- last modified field

comments - simple text box
- foreign key reference to document_sections (no version needed)
- informal foreign key reference to login.users for the source

suggestions 
- foreign key reference to document_sections and associated version
- informal foreign key reference to login.users of the source
- text blob to hold the modified json document with the suggested change

Explore using jOOQ for querying the data rather than JPA or Hibernate:
