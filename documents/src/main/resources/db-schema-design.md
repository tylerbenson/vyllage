Add tables to a database schema document similar to https://github.com/natebenson/vyllage/blob/master/login/src/main/resources/schema-h2.sql

Each table should have an autogenerated id column.  There will likely be problems if you attempt to run this project together with the login project (via launching the site project) due to classpath collisions.  For the time being, develop and run your tests with just the documents project.  I am researching how to handle this.

Needs the following tables:
(Note, not all the columns need to be defined right now, mainly just want the referencial foreign keys set up linking them.  Informal reference means name it accordingly, but don't add the table constraints.)

__accounts__ - this will eventually link to data in the users table from the login project
- informal foreign key reference to login.users
- fields to store the data found in the contact drawer

__documents__ - this is the main table which the id will represent the resume id in the url
- foreign key reference to accounts
- visibility settings for the contact data in accounts
- date created field
- last modified field

__document_sections__ - this is where those json blobs will be stored.
- section version - combined key along with the section id
- foreign key reference to documents
- section sort order
- text blob to hold the json document  (when we get postgres setup, we'll be using their json type)
- date created field
- last modified field

__comments__ - simple text box
- foreign key reference to document_sections (no version needed)
- informal foreign key reference to login.users for the source
- optional reference to comments if in response to another comment
- timestamp

__suggestions__ - displayed as a diff 
- foreign key reference to document_sections and associated version
- informal foreign key reference to login.users of the source
- text blob to hold the modified json document with the suggested change
- timestamp

Explore using jOOQ for querying the data rather than JPA or Hibernate:
- https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/blob/master/jOOQ-examples/jOOQ-spring-boot-example/

Generate the java code using either:
- http://www.jooq.org/doc/3.4/manual/code-generation/codegen-gradle/
- https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-jooq-plugin

This might be tricky since the database is currently only in memory, not actually running.  Based on the examples below, you'll likely have to switch to persisting the db file locally (if so add to git ignore):
- http://www.jooq.org/doc/3.5/manual-single-page/#jooq-with-flyway (I was previously using flyway, It should be easy to switch back)
